# First github commit


  - This app helped me to learn the importance of a user login-logout system. The Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Heartl. It was my window into understanding the power of web development, Github, the importance of version control, branching when working with collaborators, application structure (Angular and Model), MVC modeling, RESTful practices, gems, and the entirety of the Ruby universe.

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
